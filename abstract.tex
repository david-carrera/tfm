  Quantitative linguistics studies human language using statistical methods.
  Its aim is to build general theory from the statistical laws observed in a wide variety of languages.
  As part of the scientific method, this theory should be able to make novel predictions.
  This thesis is based on a family of models of human language (\cite{Ferrer2007a} and generalized in \cite{Ferrer2018a}).
  These models have shown to reproduce language laws, such as Zipf's law.
  They have also been used to make predictions, such as predicting the biases present in child word learning.
  This family of models is based on the minimization of a cost function.
  The cost function is defined using a combination of information theoretic measures on a bipartite graph of associations between words (or, more generally, forms) and meanings (more generally, counterparts).
  The model is then optimized with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method at zero temperature.
  This thesis is centered on two models belonging to this family named the \firstmodel{} and the \secondmodel{}.
  This thesis makes a variety of contributions in relation to these models.
  The mathematical equations defining them are derived, including dynamic equations which reduce the computational complexity of the optimization process.
  In addition, several techniques are introduced which aim to reduce the significant problem of numerical error due to floating point arithmetic without compromising efficiency.
  Another contribution is the replication of results obtained by previous models based on this family which had been published originally with replicability issues.
  \redtxt{TODO: escriure be els resultats obtinguts despres de acabar amb la seccio results}
  A tool has been developed and released as open source with the aim that others can easily replicate these results and investigate other properties of this family of models.
